Driving the MCOB128064JX OLED Display
There is a datasheet at  https://midasdisplays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MCOB128064JX-YM.pdf
Using the Adafruit SSD1305 Library 

However it gives limited data as to drive the display in various interface formats 
For I2C 

(1) Set jumpers JB1 High
                JB2 Low 
(2) Pin 1 VCC 
    Pin 2 GND 
    Pin 4 SCL 
    Pin 5 and 6 SDA - found by experiment!
    Pin 12 Chip Select (Low)
    Pin 14 Reset (Low) - seems to work in I2C without 
    Pin 16 High - read data from Display, Low - Command to display
        or SA0 for I2C
    Pin 6-11 parallel data - grounded

(3) Set I2C address (J1C ? Open)
    0x3C if pin 16 grounded 
    0x3D if pin 16 High

(4) ?Pin 14 Reset pin should be driven by Arduino - in this case we have set as pin 9 on the Arduino  

(5) Library has constructors for I2C, Software SPI , Hardware SPI 
    Using I2C in this case
(6) Call display.begin() after constructor 
    startup sequence
