Driving the MCOB128064JX OLED Display
There is a datasheet at  https://midasdisplays.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/MCOB128064JX-YM.pdf

However it gives limited data as to drive the display in various interface formats 
For I2C 

(1) Set jumpers JB1 High
                JB2 Low 
(2) Pin 1 VCC 
    Pin 2 GND 
    Pin 4 SCL 
    Pin 5 SDA 
    Pin 12 Chip Select (Low)
    Pin 14 Reset (Low)
    Pin 16 High - read data from Display, Low - Command to display
    Pin 6-11 parallel data - grounded

(3) Set I2C address (J1C ? Open)
    0x3C // 011110+SA0+RW - 0x3C or 0x3D     

Library has constructors for I2C, Software SPI , Hardware SPI 
Using I2C in this case
