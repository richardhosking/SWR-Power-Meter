# SWR-Power-Meter
High Performance HF Power meter using Arduino and a Directional Coupler
This drevice can measure power over a wide dynamic range from 10uW to 1 KW and will derive SWR for a 50 Ohm load 
The front end uses broadband Ferrite transformers in a Directional Coupler configuration 
AD8307 Logarithmic amplifiers derive power in a forward and reverse direction 
An Arduino Adafruit Trinket Pro 3V board performs calxcualtuions and drives a display
